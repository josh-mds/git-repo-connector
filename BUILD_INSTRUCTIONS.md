GitHub Account Manager - Build Instructions
Overview
This document provides instructions for creating executable versions of the GitHub Account Manager for different platforms.
🖥️ Windows Executable
Prerequisites

Windows 10 or later
Python 3.7 or later
Git installed

Build Steps

Save the Python script as github_account_manager.py
Save the build script as setup.py
Run the build script:
cmdpython setup.py

Find your executable:

Single executable: dist/GitHubAccountManager.exe
Portable package: GitHubAccountManager_Portable/



Distribution Options

Single File: Share GitHubAccountManager.exe (larger file, but self-contained)
Portable Package: Share the entire GitHubAccountManager_Portable/ folder
Installer: Use Inno Setup with the generated installer.iss file

📱 iOS (Important Limitations)
⚠️ iOS does not support traditional executable files like Windows .exe files.
Available Options:
Option 1: Pythonista App

Install Pythonista from App Store
Copy the Python script to Pythonista
Run within the app
Limitations: No system-level Git access, limited file system access

Option 2: Web Application

Create a web-based version of the tool
Access via Safari on iOS
Best for: Remote access to the tool

Option 3: Native iOS App Development

Rewrite using Kivy + kivy-ios
Use Xcode to build native app
Requires: macOS, iOS Developer Account, significant development time

Option 4: Remote Access

Run the Windows executable on a server/PC
Use remote desktop apps (TeamViewer, Chrome Remote Desktop)
Access from iOS device

🔧 Alternative Cross-Platform Solutions
Web Application Version
bash# Run the cross-platform build script
chmod +x build_cross_platform.sh
./build_cross_platform.sh web
Universal Python Installation
bash# Create installer for any platform with Python
./build_cross_platform.sh installer

🚀 Recommended Approach by Use Case
For Windows Users
Use the Windows executable created with PyInstaller:
cmdpython setup.py
For iOS Users
Option 1 (Easiest): Use remote access to a Windows machine
Option 2 (Most flexible): Create a web application version
For Universal Deployment
Create a web application that can be accessed from any device:
bash./build_cross_platform.sh web
🔧 Development Notes
Dependencies

GitPython: Git repository management
requests: GitHub API calls
tkinter: GUI framework (built into Python)

Build Dependencies

pyinstaller: Create Windows executables
kivy: Cross-platform GUI framework
flask: Web framework for web version

📝 Troubleshooting
Windows Build Issues

"Module not found": Run pip install -r requirements.txt
Large executable size: Normal, includes Python interpreter
Antivirus warnings: Common with PyInstaller executables

iOS Limitations

No direct file system access: iOS sandboxing prevents direct SSH key access
No subprocess calls: iOS prevents calling external commands like ssh-keygen
Solution: Create a companion web service or use remote access

General Issues

Git not found: Ensure Git is installed and in PATH
Permission denied: Check file permissions and user privileges
SSH key access: Ensure proper permissions on .ssh directory
